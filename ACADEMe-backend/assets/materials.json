Start from the rightmost column (ones place): Add the digits in each column, moving leftward.  Carry over if needed: If the sum in any column is 10 or more, write the unit digit and carry the tens digit to the next column.  Continue adding: Repeat the process for the tens, hundreds, and higher place values until all digits are added.  Write the final sum: The result obtained after adding all digits is the sum of the given numbers.",

If the top digit is smaller than the bottom digit in any column, borrowing is used from the next higher place value to complete the subtraction. This method ensures accurate calculations.    In real life, multi-digit subtraction is useful in many situations. For example, if a family plans a road trip of 865 km and has already traveled 479 km, they can subtract 479 from 865 to find out how much distance is left. Similarly, if a person had ₹1,200 and spent ₹765 on shopping, subtracting helps determine how much money remains.",
